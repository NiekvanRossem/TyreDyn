# TyreDyn
TyreDyn is an open source tyre modelling package for Python. The aim is to provide a standard python interface for the 
various tyre models in existence, similar to what [MFeval](https://mfeval.wordpress.com/) is in MATLAB. The code is 
open-source and licenced under an MIT licence, and can thus be used freely in both personal and professional 
applications.

This is a personal project, and is not associated with any company or organisation I am or have been a part of.

#### Currently supported tyre models
- MF 6.1
- MF 6.2

#### Planned future support
- PAC89
- PAC94
- PAC96
- PAC2002
- MF 5.2

## How to use
Load in your TIR file by calling `current_tyre = Tyre(<filename>.tir)`. This will create an instance of the tyre model 
class corresponding to the `FITTYP` parameter.

Some optional arguments can be passed as well. An overview is provided below:
1. `use_model_type` -- Overrides the `FITTYP` parameter in the TIR file. Compatibility is limited to MF 5.0 ~ MF 6.2. 
   Valid inputs should have one of the following formats: `52`, `MF52`, `MF5.2`, or `MF 5.2` (default is `None`).
2. `validate` -- If set to `True`, the TIR file will be validated after loading in. This checks if all used parameters 
   are present and of the right data type (default is `True`).
3. `use_alpha_star` -- Adds a correction to the slip angle signal for large angles and reverse running (default is `True`). 
4. `use_gamma_star` -- 
5. `use_lmu_star` -- 
6. `use_turn_slip` -- Adds turn-slip correction (default is `False`).
7. `check_format` -- Checks the format of the input signals: All have to be 1D arrays or lists, and either have the same 
   length or be of type `float`/`int` (default is `True`).
8. `check_limits` -- Checks if inputs are within the range specified in the TIR file, and clips them if not (default is 
   `True`).
9. `use_mfeval_mode` -- Compatibility mode with MFeval. If set to `True`, the output list of `find_full_state` matches 
   that of MFeval, if set to `False`, the outputs are organised on parameter type (default is `False`).

#### Dependencies:
1. NumPy
2. Pydantic (TIR validation only)
3. Matplotlib (example notebooks only)

## Current status
This package is currently a work in progress. The current status (as of 1 January 2026) is:
- MF 6.1 and MF 6.2 are implemented and functional
- Still needs detailed testing to check whether `TyreDyn`, `MFeval`, and `MF-Tool` give the same outputs.
- A lot of work related to making this a proper python library need to be done as well. Think version management, etc.

## Statement on AI use
I used this project to explore how AI could be best be used as a coding assistant. The goal was not to outsource my 
thinking to an LLM, or to have it otherwise create the project instead of me. Instead, it was used as an assistant and 
teacher, providing me with various choices regarding implementation, and showing the trade-offs between them. More 
specifically, ChatGPT-5 was used to provide advice on project architecture related decisions (think folder structure, 
OOP specific implementation choices, et cetera). It was also used to write simple utility functions, like extracting 
data from a file, or creating visualizations. Implementing the equations of the various tyre models was done without the 
help of AI.

All code written by ChatGPT is clearly marked as such in the docstring, and as been properly tested before 
implementation. Code written by other people is also marked as such in the docstring. Unmarked code is written by me.
